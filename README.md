## Hyden HockeyStack Table


I found this resource really helpful:
https://adamlynch.com/flexible-data-tables-with-css-grid/


Improvements I'd like to make:
- add a loading state for data
- instead of pagination, make it infinite scrolling instead, I hate unecessary clicks in general
- could be helpful to add a search functionality, depending on the dataset

I'd also like to improve the styling of the table, it's a little bland as is, and long headers don't look great.
I think I could improve the header design a lot with some better overflow handling so they are not multiple lines, maybe some hover state or something.
The sort buttons also feel a little "light", and could use improvement.
